**Heapsort Implementation and Analysis**

To run the heap sort comparison, you can run python `main.py`. It will generate several types of random arrays, and compare the sorting times of merge sort, quick sort and heap sort for each of them.

My results show that heap sort is consistently slower than the other 2 implementations, but it offers a constant time for the same length of the soruce array, regardless of the contents.

You can find more information in Heap Sort.md (TODO: add link))
